I recently switched over to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from a Wordpress/Hostgator setup that I disliked due to pricing and the fact that I didn't need such a chunky website.

This site is built using ~~[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is pretty awesome; I enjoy working with it~~. ~~[I'm using Hugo now!](https://gohugo.io/)~~ I'm using Netlifys Next.js CMS template. And I love it even MORE than ~~Jekyll~~ Hugo. I have some blog posts I am working on and hope to have them up soon.

Anyways, thanks for visiting; have a splendid day.
